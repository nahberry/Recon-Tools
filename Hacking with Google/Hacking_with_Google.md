## Commands (or "dorks") for the world most popular search engine  


* __cache__: this command will show you the cached version of any website, e.g. cache: securitytrails.com  

* __allintext__: searches for specific text contained on any web page, e.g. allintext: hacking tools  

* __allintitle__: exactly the same as allintext, but will show pages that contain titles with X characters, e.g. allintitle:"Security Companies"  

* __allinurl__: it can be used to fetch results whose URL contains all the specified characters, e.g: allinurl client area  

* __filetype__: used to search for any kind of file extensions, for example, if you want to search for jpg files you can use: filetype: jpg  

* __inurl__: this is exactly the same as allinurl, but it is only useful for one single keyword, e.g. inurl: admin  

* __intitle__: used to search for various keywords inside the title, for example, intitle:security tools will search for titles beginning with “security” but “tools” can be somewhere else in the page.  

* __inanchor__: this is useful when you need to search for an exact anchor text used on any links, e.g. inanchor:"cyber security"  

* __intext__: useful to locate pages that contain certain characters or strings inside their text, e.g. intext:"safe internet"  

* __link__: will show the list of web pages that have links to the specified URL, e.g. link: microsoft.com  

* __site__: will show you the full list of all indexed URLs for the specified domain and subdomain, e.g. site:securitytrails.com  

* __*__: wildcard used to search pages that contain “anything” before your word, e.g. how to * a website, will return “how to…” design/create/hack, etc… “a website”.  

* __|__: this is a logical operator, e.g. "security" "tips" will show all the sites which contain “security” or “tips,” or both words.  

* __+__: used to concatenate words, useful to detect pages that use more than one specific key, e.g. security + trails  

* __–__: minus operator is used to avoiding showing results that contain certain words, e.g. security -trails will show pages that use “security” in their text, but not those that have the word “trails.”
